/**
 * @title sJUSDUpgradeable
 * @dev Staked JUSD (sJUSD) - an interest-bearing token that represents JUSD staked in the protocol.
 * The token's value increases over time relative to JUSD, reflecting staking rewards.
 * Implements ERC4626 Tokenized Vault Standard.
 * 
 * @dev Staking Mechanics:
 * - Users deposit JUSD and receive sJUSD shares in return
 * - The exchange rate between JUSD and sJUSD can increase over time as rewards are added
 * - The value of sJUSD (relative to JUSD) never decreases, making it a yield-bearing asset
 * 
 * @dev Unstaking Process:
 * - 2-step withdrawal process: cooldown, then unstake
 * - Cooldown initiates an unstaking period based on the cooldown duration
 * - Users cannot withdraw their shares until the cooldown period expires
 * - When cooldown duration is set to 0, direct withdrawals are allowed without cooldown
 * 
 * @dev Upgrade Features:
 * - Uses TransparentUpgradeableProxy pattern
 * - The admin role can upgrade the implementation contract
 * - TimelockController is set as the proxy admin to provide time-delayed governance
 * 
 * @dev Security Features:
 * - Based on OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts
 * - Admin role is required for changing critical parameters
 * - Rescue function for recovering non-JUSD tokens sent to the contract accidentally
 * - Safeguards against withdrawing during cooldown period
 * 
 * @dev Integration Notes:
 * - Fully compatible with ERC4626 interfaces for better composability
 * - Implements maxWithdraw and maxDeposit to properly communicate withdrawal limitations
 * - Uses ERC20Permit for gasless approvals
