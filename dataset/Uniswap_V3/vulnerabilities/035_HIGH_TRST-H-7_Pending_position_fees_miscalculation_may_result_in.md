# TRST-H-7 Pending position fees miscalculation may result in increased PnL

**Severity:** HIGH
**Auditor:** Trust Security

---

**Description:**
When calculating pending liquidity position fees, **liquidity, tokensOwed0, and tokensOwed1**
are read from a Uniswap V3 pool using a position belonging to the 
NonfungiblePositionManager contract. However, the read values will also include the liquidity 
and the owed token amounts of all Uniswap V3 users who deposited funds in the price range 
of the position via the NonfungiblePositionManager contract. Since 
NonfungiblePositionManager manages positions in pools on behalf of users, the positions will 
hold liquidity of all NonfungiblePositionManager users. As a result, the PnL of 
UniswapV3Strategy positions may be significantly increased, resulting in increased payouts to 
lenders and loss of funds to borrowers/liquidators.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Consider reading the values of liquidity, **tokensOwed0, and tokensOwed1** from the 
`IUniswapV3NPM(uniV3NPM).positions()` call on line 95. The call returns values specifically for 
the position identified by the token ID.

**Team response:**
Fixed.

**Mitigation Review:**
The team has fixed it as recommended to make the logic correct.
