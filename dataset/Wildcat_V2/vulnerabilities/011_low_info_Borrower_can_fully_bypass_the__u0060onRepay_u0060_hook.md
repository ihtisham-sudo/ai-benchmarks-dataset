# Vulnerability details

## Impact
Borrower can bypass calls to the \u0060onRepay\u0060 hook

## Proof of Concept
Within the protocol, users are free to implement markets with a set of hooks, including a \u0060onRepay\u0060 hook which is intended to be called any time a repayment is made.

\u0060\u0060\u0060solidity
  function _repay(MarketState memory state, uint256 amount, uint256 baseCalldataSize) internal {
    if (amount == 0) revert_NullRepayAmount();
    if (state.isClosed) revert_RepayToClosedMarket();

    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    emit_DebtRepaid(msg.sender, amount);

    // Execute repay hook if enabled
    hooks.onRepay(amount, state, baseCalldataSize);
  }
\u0060\u0060\u0060

However, the problem is that any funds transferred directly to the contract are treated as a repayment by the borrower. This does allow the borrower, any time they wish to make a repayment, they can just send the funds to the contract and avoid the \u0060onRepay\u0060 hook (as it may apply restrictions, extra fees or generally - anything)

This basically makes the \u0060onRepay\u0060 hook useless.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider either using internal accounting or removing the \u0060onRepay\u0060 hook.
