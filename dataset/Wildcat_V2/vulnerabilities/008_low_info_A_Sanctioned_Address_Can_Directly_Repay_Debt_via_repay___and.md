# Vulnerability details

## Description

The [WildcatMarket](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-wildcat/blob/fe746cc0fbedc4447a981a50e6ba4c95f98b9fe1/src/market/WildcatMarket.sol#L202) in its current implementation, contract allows sanctioned addresses to repay debt, violating the sponsor\u0027s invariant that [sanctioned accounts should not modify the market state](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-08-the-wildcat-protocol#:~:text=mint%20market%20tokens.-,Accounts%20which%20are%20flagged,in%20nukeFromOrbit%20and%20executeWithdrawal).
The \u0060repay()\u0060 and \u0060repayOutstandingDebt()\u0060 functions lacks a sanction check, contrary to other state-modifying functions like \u0060borrow()\u0060.

Let\u0027s take a look at the \u0060repay()\u0060 and \u0060repayOutstandingDebt()\u0060 implementations from \u0060WildcatMarket.sol\u0060:
\u0060\u0060\u0060solidity
  function repay(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant sphereXGuardExternal {
    //@audit missing sanction check for sender
    if (amount == 0) revert_NullRepayAmount();

    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    emit_DebtRepaid(msg.sender, amount);

    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();
    if (state.isClosed) revert_RepayToClosedMarket();

    hooks.onRepay(amount, state, _runtimeConstant(0x24));

    _writeState(state);
}
\u0060\u0060\u0060
Also in \u0060repayOutstandingDebt()\u0060:
\u0060\u0060\u0060
  function repayOutstandingDebt() external nonReentrant sphereXGuardExternal {
    MarketState memory state = _getUpdatedState();
    uint256 outstandingDebt = state.totalDebts().satSub(totalAssets());
    _repay(state, outstandingDebt, 0x04);
    _writeState(state);
  }

\u0060\u0060\u0060
What matters is that sanctioned entities are not receiving or sending funds to the market, as this could put other lenders in a precarious legal situation. However, as seen in the implementation above, there is no restriction preventing sanctioned addresses from calling these functions and sending funds into the market directly.

## Impact
The lack of restrictions allows sanctioned addresses to, in fact, interact with the market, modify its state, and essentially circumvent financial regulations. This violates the key invariant stated in the guidelines: "[Accounts which are flagged as sanctioned on Chainalysis should never be able to successfully modify the state of the market unless the borrower specifically overrides their sanctioned status in the sentinel (other than token approvals, or through their tokens being withdrawn & escrowed in nukeFromOrbit and executeWithdrawal)](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-08-the-wildcat-protocol#:~:text=mint%20market%20tokens.-,Accounts%20which%20are%20flagged,in%20nukeFromOrbit%20and%20executeWithdrawal)."

Also worth noting is that this was completely missed in the [v1 audit competition](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-10-wildcat) last year (though I did not participate in the contest).

## Proof of Concept

Unlike the \u0060deposit()\u0060 and \u0060borrow()\u0060 functions, which include the necessary check, a sanctioned address can bypass the sanction check by directly calling the \u0060repay()\u0060 or \u0060repayOutstandingDebt()\u0060 functions.

## Recommendation:
Implement a sanction check in the \u0060repay()\u0060 and \u0060repayOutstandingDebt()\u0060 functions, similar to the check in the borrow function.
