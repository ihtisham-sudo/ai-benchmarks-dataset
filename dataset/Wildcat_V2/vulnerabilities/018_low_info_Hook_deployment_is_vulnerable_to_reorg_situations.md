# Vulnerability details

### Impact

Hook deployment is not protected from reorg situations, even though protocol plans on deployment to chains that are very vulnerable to block reorgs. This will cause markets to be deployed with the wrong hooks, messing up users\u0027 potential hook configurations.

### Proof of Concept

The protocol plans to deploy on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon. Re-orgs can happen in all EVM chains. Not super common on Ethereum, but still [happens](https://decrypt.co/101390/ethereum-beacon-chain-blockchain-reorg). The same also occurs on Poylgon, which has [experienced large re-orgs in the past.](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388) and on Optimistic and Arbitrum rollups.

\u0060_deployHooksInstance\u0060 uses the ordinary "create" to deploy the hooks, 

\u0060\u0060\u0060solidity
      let initCodeSizeWithArgs := add(add(initCodeSize, 0x60), constructorArgsSize)
      // Deploy the contract with the initcode
      hooksInstance := create(0, initCodePointer, initCodeSizeWithArgs)
\u0060\u0060\u0060
therefore during multiple hook/market deployments through the \u0060deployMarketAndHooks\u0060 and \u0060deployMarket\u0060 functions, a reorg situation will lead to a "swap" of address instances, in which the reorganization of chain blocks will lead to a different address instance being attached to another hook, other than the one it would have gotten in case of a normal deployment. In short, hook deployment A gets address instance B, rather than address instance A that it would have gotten in case of a normal deployment. 
in case of multiple deployments with the \u0060deployMarketAndHooks\u0060 function will cause the wrong hooksinstance to be attached to the wrong markets, which could tamper with various expected market configurations and lead to unexpected behaviour. Also, if the deployer uses the initially derived address and sends funds to the address, the switch in address instance will make the funds open to the other deployment, leading to loss of funds.

### Tools Used
 Manual code review
 
### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend using CREATE2 instead which uses salt that contains msg.sender to deploy hooks instead.
