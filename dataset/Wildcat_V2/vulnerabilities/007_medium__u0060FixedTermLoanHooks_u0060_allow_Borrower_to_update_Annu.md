# Vulnerability details

## Summary
While the documentation states that in case of \u0027fixed term\u0027 market the APR cannot be changed until the term ends, nothing prevents this in \u0060FixedTermLoanHooks\u0060.

## Vulnerability details
In Wildcat markets, lenders know in advance how much \u0060APR\u0060 the borrower will pay them. In order to allow lenders to exit the market swiftly, the market must always have at least a \u0060reserve ratio\u0060 of the lender funds ready to be withdrawn.
If the borrower decide to [reduce the \u0060APR\u0060](https://docs.wildcat.finance/using-wildcat/day-to-day-usage/borrowers#reducing-apr), in order to allow lenders to \u0027ragequit\u0027, a new \u0060reserve ratio\u0060 is calculated based on the variation of the APR as described in the link above.
Finally, is a market implement a fixed term (date until when withdrawals are not possible), it shouldn\u0027t be able to reduce the APR, as this would allow the borrower to \u0027rug\u0027 the lenders by reducing the APR to 0% while they couldn\u0027t do anything against that.

The issue here is that while lenders are (as expected) prevented to withdraw before end of term:

this is not the case for the borrower setting the annual interest:

## Impact
Borrower can rug the lenders by reducing the APR while they cannot quit the market

## Proof of Concept

Add this test to \u0060test/access/FixedTermLoanHooks.t.sol\u0060

\u0060\u0060\u0060
  function testAudit_SetAnnualInterestBeforeTermEnd() external {
    DeployMarketInputs memory inputs;

	// "deploying" a market with MockFixedTermLoanHooks
	inputs.hooks = EmptyHooksConfig.setHooksAddress(address(hooks));
	hooks.onCreateMarket(
		address(this),				// deployer
		address(1),				// dummy market address
		inputs,					// ...
		abi.encode(block.timestamp + 365 days, 0) // fixedTermEndTime: 1 year, minimumDeposit: 0
	);

	vm.prank(address(1));
	MarketState memory state;
	// as the fixedTermEndTime isn\u0027t past yet, it\u0027s not possible to withdraw
	vm.expectRevert(FixedTermLoanHooks.WithdrawBeforeTermEnd.selector);
	hooks.onQueueWithdrawal(address(1), 0, 1, state, \u0027\u0027);

	// but it is still possible to reduce the APR to zero
	hooks.onSetAnnualInterestAndReserveRatioBips(0, 0, state, "");
  }

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

When \u0060FixedTermLoanHooks::onSetAnnualInterestAndReserveRatioBips\u0060 is called, revert if \u0060market.fixedTermEndTime > block.timestamp\u0060
