# [C-01] Users can split a token to more fractions than the `units` held at `tokenID`

**Severity:** HIGH
**Auditor:** Pashov Audit Group

---

**Impact**
High, as it breaks an important protocol invariant

**Likelihood**
High, as those types of issues are common and are easily exploitable

**Description**

The `_splitValue` method in `SemiFungible1155` does not follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and it calls `_mintBatch` from the ERC1155 implementation of OpenZeppelin which will actually do a hook call to the recipient account as a safety check. This call is unsafe as it can reenter the `_splitValue` method and since `tokenValues[_tokenID]` hasn't been updated yet, it can once again split the tokens into more fractions and then repeat until a huge amount of tokens get minted.

**Recommendation**

Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

```diff
-_mintBatch(_account, toIDs, amounts, "");
-
-tokenValues[_tokenID] = valueLeft;
+tokenValues[_tokenID] = valueLeft;
+
+_mintBatch(_account, toIDs, amounts, "");
```
