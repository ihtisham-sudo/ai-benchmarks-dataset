The owner of `RoyaltyVault` can set `_platformFee` to any arbitrary value (e.g. 100% = 10000) and that share of the contracts balance and future balances will be set to the `platformFeeRecipient` (which is in the owners control) rather than the splitter contract.

As a result the owner can steal the entire contract balance and any future balances avoiding the splitter.

### Proof of Concept

        function setPlatformFee(uint256 _platformFee) external override onlyOwner {
            platformFee = _platformFee;
            emit NewRoyaltyVaultPlatformFee(_platformFee);
        }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This issue may be mitigated by add a maximum value for the `_platformFee` say 5% (or some reasonable value based on the needs of the platform).

Also consider calling `sendToSplitter()` before adjusting the `platformFee`. This will only allow the owner to change the fee for future value excluding the current contract balance.

Consider the following code.

        function setPlatformFee(uint256 _platformFee) external override onlyOwner {
            require(_platformFee < MAX_FEE);
            sendToSplitter(); // @audit this will need to be public rather than external
            platformFee = _platformFee;
            emit NewRoyaltyVaultPlatformFee(_platformFee);
        }

 > Instead of having to come up with a "reasonable" `MAX_FEE`, consider instead just preventing the fee from ever being raised, and only allowing it to be lowered.

**[deluca-mike (judge) increased severity to High and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-joyn-findings/issues/9#issuecomment-1105964175):**
 > While I was originally leaning Medium Risk, after taking the arguments made by the duplicate issues into account, I am now leaning High Risk. The rationale is that, a DOS of `sendToSplitter` via a high `platformFee` not only harms stakeholders of the `RoyaltyVault` that would get the remainder of the balance, split, but may also prevent all NFT transfers if `sendToSplitter` is hooked into as part of all token transfer, via royalty payments. A malicious or disgruntled `RoyaltyVault` owner can hold all the NFTs hostage that call `sendToSplitter` atomically on transfers.
> 
> So there are 2 issues that need to be solved here:
> - protect NFT holders by ensuring `platformFee` (or any other values) cannot be set to a value that would cause `sendToSplitter` to fail (`splitterShare = 0` or `platformShare > balanceOfVault`), or don't have `sendToSplitter` be called on NFT transfers
> - protect royalty split recipients by putting an arbitrary max to the fee, or only allowing the fee to be reduced
